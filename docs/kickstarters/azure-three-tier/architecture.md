# Architecture

## Introduction
Where can you use this template?

[Diagram goes here]

## Deployment View

### Components

**App Service**

Azure App Service is a fully managed service for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. The virtual network integration feature of App Service can give your app access to resources in or through a virtual network.

**Azure Active Directory**

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service.

**Virtual Network**

Azure Virtual Network is a secure private network in the cloud. It connects Azure Resources to one another, to the internet, and to on-premises networks.

**Azure Bastion**

Azure Bastion is a fully managed service that provides more secure and seamless Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to virtual machines (VMs) without any exposure through public IP addresses.

**Azure SQL**

Azure SQL Database is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) database engine that handles most of the database management functions.


### Workflows

Here's the traffic flow and basic configuration of the architecture:

1. Requests route from the internet to a front-end app.
2. Azure AD B2C is used for the authentication. Only authenticated users can access the application.
3. The traffic from the backend API to the database is routed through the virtual network. App Service regional VNet integration is enabled for this purpose. 
4. Azure SQL database is used for storing the data. The resouces in the virual netowork can access the database as we have enabled service endpoint connectivity for Azure SQL databases. And the public internet access is prohibited. 
5. Azure Bastion service is used for accessing the environment and the database securely. 


Why did we use Azure AD B2C?

Why did we use a Virtual Network/VNET integration?

Why did we use service endpoints?
[contrast with private endpoints]

Why did we use Azure Bastion?
