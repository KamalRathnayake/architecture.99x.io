# IaC Template for Building a Three-Tier App on Azure

This is a kickstarter IaC tempalte for Azure that can be used as a starting point for you Azure Three Tier applicatiom. The tempalte contians a simple Todo application. You can easily get rid of the existing code as it is there just to show how the template works. 

The todo application contains five basic features and we have designed this application keeping quality attributes like high-scalability, availability and security in mind. If your project has these requirements this would be a great fit. 

We have built this keeping the IaC components highly modular if you find any component that you think is not required for the application that you are developing. You can easily get rid of that.

This is an open template and if you find anything to add/improve, please go ahead and don't forget to merge it back to this.
