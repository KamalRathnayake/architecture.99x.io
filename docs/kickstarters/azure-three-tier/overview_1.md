# IaC Template for Building a Three-Tier App on Azure

This is a kickstarter IaC tempalte for Azure that can be used as a starting point for you Azure Three Tier application. The tempalte contians a simple Todo application. 

The todo application contains five basic features and we have designed this application keeping following quality attributes in mind. 

* High-scalability - Scales into millions of requests per minute
* Availability - Resiliency to even regional data center outages
* Security - Protected from common security threats for web apps. Like SQL injection, Cross-site-scripting attacks

If your project has these requirements this would be a great fit. You can easily get rid of the existing code as it is there just to show how the template works. 

We have built this keeping the IaC components highly modular if you find any component that you think is not required for the application that you are developing. You can easily get rid of that. This is an open template and if you find anything to add/improve, please go ahead and don't forget to merge it back to this.
