# Technical Overview - Azure Three Tier IaC Kickstarter

Followings are the quality attributes that we are designing this template for. 

*  Scalability 
    - One million requests per minute
    - Scaling down when there are less requests
    - Use load balancers and horizontal scaling

- Availability  
    - Time to fetch data must be minimal
    - The data must be redundant
    - Setup and automate backup data storage

*  Security 
    - Only authenticated users can perform operations within the application
    - Generate audit logs for user actions
    - Apply data masking for user sensitive data in the database
    - Avoid exposing unnecessary resources (database, storage, etc) to public network


# Modules

The demo project contains a sample Todo application. Following list contains the high level functionality that this todo app includes.

## Soft delete Todos

- [400 - bad request] type response will be returned with the meaningful message if the given id is not existed.

## Authentication

Azure AD is used for user management and authentication purposes of the todo application.
Username and password combination is used for the login purposes.
Based on available permissions, user authorization for the APIs are carried out.
